Slider Element

Exercise 1
Make an equalizer GUI with Bass, Mid and Treble settings

Instructions:
Make a window that implements a basic equalizer
Use 3 sliders that have a range of 0 to 100
Add a label under each slider
You don't have to be precise, a single Text element with spaces between each label is fine
Include 1 buttons
Ok - Shows a popup of the values dictionary returned from window.read()
Reset - Sets the values to 0 for all sliders
